My solution to the university class ASP web development and MVC

Known issues so far: due to time constraints, I did not have time to fix some of the issues I encountered
- ugly UI :(
- contents of date field are not displayed on EDIT views
- general exceptions (e.g., server not responding or some of the http error codes) are not displayed properly

Room for improvement: issues aside, there are some features I would like to integrate in the future
- general error handling in a middleware
- better-structured angular project, integrating modules
- integrate generics into angular project
- use store instead of local storage, solve problem of invalid tokens over extrended use
- move all configuration to config files on both server and client
- the admin is more like a superuser atm, add real use and admin capabilities
